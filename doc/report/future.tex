\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{MPI} implementation is very simple and there might be
performance gains in a more refined solution.
\item We belive that the dynamically allocated associative array for
  the reporting could be changed to a pre-allocated static vector. According to the
  Table \ref{tab:comb} below the 6 dimensional matrix has 432000 cells
  with $\sim$3MB data, that could be projected to a sparse
  vector. The sparsity would result in overhead for small simulations,
  but the static allocation could save overhead for large simulations.

      state & grade & dx & psa & cohort      & age & number of combinations \\
      \hline
      3     & 3     & 3  & 2   & (1980-1900) & 100 & 432 000                \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}

\item We could use averages of the timings instead of single measurements to better
  evalute the performance of \texttt{MPI + openMP}.
