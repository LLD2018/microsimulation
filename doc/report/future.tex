\section{Future work}
Besides combining the openMP solution with MPI, which we have already
mentioned. 

We belive that the dynamically allocated associative array
(\texttt{map<,>} caould be changed to a static vector. According to the
Table \ref{tab:comb} below the matrix currently has 432000 cells
($\sim$3MB). The sparsity would result in overhead for small
simulations, but the static allocation could save overhead for large simulations.
