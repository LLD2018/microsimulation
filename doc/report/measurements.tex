\subsection{Baseline measurements}

\subsubsection{R-side}

    the C++-code which can be run in parallel.}

To motivate the need and choice to go parallel Figure \ref{fig:Rself})
shows the processes from the R-side where ".Call" is the part
which is implemented in C++ and which can be run in parallel.
