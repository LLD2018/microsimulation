\subsection{Compilation flags}

For the improved OpenMP, we continued with investigating the
performance effect of compilation flags. For an R package the \texttt{CXX}
flags can be set in multiple ways, we first tried to change the
R package specific setting, in \texttt{/src/Makevars}, but for our
settings to achieve precedence over the Ferlin system settings we had
to set the flags in \texttt{.R/Makevars}. In Figure
\ref{fig:flagScaling} we compare the performance effect of using
the compilation flags \texttt{-O2}, \texttt{-O3} and \texttt{-Ofast
  -funroll-all-loops} for a number of cores. The effect of setting
compilation flags is small in comparison to the effect of using
multiple cores.
