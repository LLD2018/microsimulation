\section{Introduction}

The software in question, microsimulation (ref to github), implements
a probabilistic model, on a person to person level, of the occurence
of prostate cancer in men from the age 35 and above. It also includes
means of modelling different health care policies (such as screening
of population at certain ages), the performance of the different tests
utilised, the probability that a person A with symptoms B seeks care
themselves, and so forth.

By generating a population, and performing microsimulation (ref),
i.e., follow each person (unit) over their life span, and then sort
the outcome in different predefined categories, the effect of
different policies are evaluated. This fulfills the the criteria of
the map-reduce paradigm, where the simulation is the map step, and the
sorting into different categories is the reduction step.

The software has been developed ``organically'' over the years, the
first version being implemented in C, then later in C++. It is called
from R, using the Rcpp (ref) package. If we can reduce the execution
time, and/or increase the sample size, different policies can be
evaluated, and better accuracy obtained.

We choose to first adapt the code to use OpenMP to see if any
improvements could be achieved, and if time permitted, OpenMP and
MPI. The first in order to decrease the execution time, and the second
to allow for much larger sample sizes. In the end, it turned out that
we only had time to adapt the code to OpenMP.


% % Description of the package and its architecture.
% Purpose 
% Package to perform so called microsimulation. Sample population is
% generated, using a probalistic model of prostate cancer, follows
% persons (micro unit). Implementing different so called policies
% regarding screening, treatment, and try to evaluate their effect in
% terms of survival rates, cost for health care and so forth.


% % Technical
% Invoked from R. Fulfills the map-reduce computational
% model/paradigm. (Describe how it fulfills the map-reduce paradigm).
% Reduce step is ensemble averages (c.f., micro vs. macro states in
% statistical physics; Sample population generation -> apply operation
% rules (map step), collect statistics according to the defined criteria
% (reduce step)).

% % Aim
% Shorten execution time drastically to be able to try out a large
% amount of different policies. Want to be able to run larger
% models. First aim, OpenMp, second aim means MPI or equivalent, i.e..
