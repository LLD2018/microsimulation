\title{
 Example of calling a microsimulation.
}
\description{
  A very simple example of calling a microsimulation.
}
\usage{
callPersonSimulation(n=500L)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{ number of simulations.}

  %- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\details{
  The actual model is based on Chilcott's model of prostate cancer
  natural history. However, only the life-time due to other causes is
  reported (assuming a Weibull distribution).
}
\value{
  the mean and standard deviation of the person-time.
